        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            I first met Nadine on <strong>October 31</strong>. Her favorite colors are red and blue, which somehow reflect her vibrant and calm nature perfectly. 
            Nadine’s birthday is on <strong>November 22</strong>, a day as special as she is.
        </p>
        <h2>Why I Love Her</h2>
        <p>
            Nadine is not just beautiful , she is more than beautiful – in fact, that’s not why I fell for her. It’s her childishness, her ability to be as weird, crazy, and stupid as me that captured my heart. She’s everything I’ve ever dreamed of and more. I love to talk with her even though there is 5 hour time difference between our countries.
        </p>
        <h2>Her Dreams</h2>
        <p>
           Being from Tunisia , Nadine dreams of becoming a successful model and a beauty social media influencer one day. She has the determination, charm, and talent to achieve her goals.  
            I believe in her with all my heart and will always support her, every step of the way. 
        </p>
        <h2>Her Hobbies & Quirks</h2>
        <p>
            Nadine loves writing and has a passion for expressing herself through words. Though she usually hates flowers, she has a soft spot for roses. She really loves the country Spain very much. She also loves to go for a run every now and then .
        </p>
        <h2>Oreo - Her Adorable Husky</h2>
        <p>
            Nadine has a cute dog named <strong>Oreo</strong>, a beautiful husky with different-colored eyes. Oreo is as unique and special as she is!
